A dark theme stylesheet to override Synology Audio Station's eye-melting theme. Tested in v6.5.5 of AS and 6.2.3 of DSM. Other versions may or may not work.

### Usage
You'll need a browser extension to modify live site CSS, such as the Stylus extension for Firefox or Chrome. For Stylus, go to your Synology DSM page in your browser, click the Stylus toolbar icon, and select the "Write style for" option. Copy the code from the CSS file in this repository and paste it into the editor that just opened. Save the changes and you should be done.

Note: Does currently override some non-AudioStation menus unless you use an AudioStation-specific URL and match the stylesheet with that URL. Also, makes the main list scrollbar thicker and more visible. Does not currently modify the mini-player.
