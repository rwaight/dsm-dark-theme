A dark theme stylesheet to override Synology Audio Station's eye-melting theme

###Usage
You'll need a browser extension to modify live site CSS, such as the Stylus extension for Firefox. For Stylus, go to your Synology DSM in your browser, click the Stylus toolbar icon, and select the "Write style for" option. Copy the code from the CSS file here and paste it into the editor that just appeared. Save the changes and you should be done.
